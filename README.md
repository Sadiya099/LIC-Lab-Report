# Linear Integrated Circuits Lab Report
# Experiment 1: CS AMPLIFIER
# Introduction:
A Common Source (CS) amplifier, optimized for low-power applications, is designed and analysed using a 180nm TSMC MOSFET in LTSpice. To evaluate the amplifier's DC operating point, voltage gain, bandwidth, and power consumption, it employs data from DC, AC and transient analyses while operating at VDD = 1.8V and with a 50W power budget. Low-power VLSI systems are made more efficient with a combination of high gain and wide bandwidth, which minimizes power consumption.
# Aim:
 To analyse the common source amplifier using 180nm tsmc  cmos n-mosfet for a given V_DD = 1.8V & determine bandwidth , gain, DC operating point, power and draw its frequency response.
