# Experiment 3: DIFFERENTIAL MOS AMPLIFIER

## AIM : Design the MOS differential amplifier circuit and perform DC analysis, Transient analysis, AC analysis using LTSpice.

## THEORY
MOS differential amplifier is a circuit,primarily used to amplify the difference between two input signals while rejecting common-mode noise. It consists of two NMOS transistors with their sources connected together and biased by a current source. The gate terminals receive the differential input signals, while the drain terminals provide the output. The load can be a current source or a resistor or NMOS FET

The circuit operates in the active region, where a small difference in gate voltages results in a significant change in drain currents, generating a differential output voltage. The common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) is a key advantage, interference affecting both inputs equally is minimized. The gain of the amplifier depends on the transconductance (gm) of the transistors and the load resistance (RD).

To ensure proper operation, the tail current source provides a stable bias current, ensuring that both transistors share current based on the input difference. The NMOS differential amplifier is widely used in operational amplifiers,due to its high gain, stability, and noise rejection.

## COMPONENTS USED 
1. Q1 & Q2 (NMOS Transistors):These form the differential pair and are responsible for amplifying the difference between the two input voltages.

2. I_bias (Current Source): This provides a constant tail current to the differential pair, ensuring proper operation. It sets the total current available for both transistors and controls the amplifierâ€™s gain and biasing.

3. R1 & R2 (Load Resistors): These resistors convert the drain currents of Q1 and Q2 into voltage signals.

4. +V (Supply Voltage): Provides the necessary power for the circuit.

5. Vin1 & Vin2 (Differential Inputs): These are the input signals applied to the gates of Q1 and Q2.

6. Vout1 & Vout2 (Differential Outputs): The output is taken from the drains of Q1 and Q2. The differential output is Vout = Vout1 - Vout2.

### Design Specification : V_DD = 3.3V ,P <= 3mW, Vicm = 1.72V, Vocm = 1.81V, Vp = 0.7V 
### Circuit Analysis
WKT P = V_DD * I_SS

I_SS = P / V_DD = 3mW / 3.3V = 0.91mA

I_D1 = I_D2 = I_SS / 2 = 0.91mA / 2 = 0.455mA

R_SS = Vp / I_SS = 0.7V / 0.91mA = 769.230 ohm

R_D = (V_DD - Vocm) / I_D1 = (3.3V - 1.81V) / 0.455mA  = 3.274k ohm

**Q point (V_DS, I_D)**

V_G = Vicm = 1.72V

V_S = Vp = 0.7V

V_D = Vocm = 1.81V

V_DS = Vocm - Vp = 1.81V - 0.7V = 1.11V

V_GS = Vicm - Vp = 1.72V - 0.7V = 1.02V

**Q point ( 1.11V , 0.455mA)**

![circuitVgsvth](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b5da7b7-74af-479b-93bd-e10686163206)

By Considering Circuit Analysis which made earlier we can say that

I_SS = 0.91mA

R_D = 3.274k ohm

R_SS = 769.230 ohm

V_DS = 1.11V

V_GS = 1.02V

V_th = 0.48V

V_OV = V_GS - V_th = 1.02V - 0.48V = 0.54V 

For Saturation region V_DS > V_OV 

i.e., 1.11V > 0.54V 

gm = ID/2*Vov = 0.455mA/2 * 0.54 = 0.8425 mA/V

Small Signal gain Av = gm * R_d = 0.8425mA *3.274kohm = 2.758

Therefore FET is in saturation region.

**If the value of Vicm increases from 1.72 to 1.82 i.e, increased by 0.1V then**

![circuit1_opincres](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/989ab963-ad82-46ca-bb50-4f44e5cb2fe4)
